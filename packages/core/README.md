# object-oriented-tests-core

**This package is a fork of the [@testdeck/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@testdeck/core)**

In this fork methods `beforeAll` and `afterAll` are instance of test class unlike the original package where they
were static. This is made for easier and more convenient work with NestJS

The package is for the integration of both test frameworks and IOC containers.
